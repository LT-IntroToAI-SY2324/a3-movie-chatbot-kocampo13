# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search_pa_list function searches the database (a pattern) and helps match it with the information put in. If it odes not find a matching pattern then it returns 'I don't understnad' or 'No answers.'

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the movie 'Hereditary' and it was made in the year 2018 as well as the movie 'Under the Same Moon" made in 2007. There is no specific reason why I added them but I remember watching the movie in theaters with my family. 

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
The pattern action I added to the paList data structure was the This is a useful pattern because it narrows the list for matching and is looking for something more specific. 

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
A chatbot that I would create that would be like this is one that can identify horror games depending on the year it was made or the difficulty of the game. I would create it for people who like to know how hard a game is before playing it but also exploring how games have developed over the years. 

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
Testing the asserts for some of the pattern actions was confusing. I was stuck on the title_by_year_range portion. 

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes, I did write a new assert for the pattern action.
